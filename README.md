#### _Final Project - Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree - Restaurant Reviews_

## Overview

The aim of this project is to incrementally convert a static webpage into a fully responsive, accessible, and mobile-ready web application.
The intial goal is to take the static design provided by Udacity and to make this responsive to a variety of screen sizes and to add accessibility for screen reader use. Finally, some assets will be cached for offline use, moving the application towards a Progressive Web App. 

## Instructions

To try this application, download or clone the project and open the `index.html` file from the project directory. Test the accessibility features by navigating through the page using `Tab` / `Shift + Tab`. If you are using Google Chrome, you can check how the responsive design appears on mobile devices or other screen sizes by opening the Chrome Dev Tools panel (`Ctrl + Shift + J`) and selecting a device type from the dropdown above the document view window. Alternatively you can resize the window using the slider in between the document view and the dev tools panel.
